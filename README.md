## 🏗 Project Workflow

1. **Code Commit**  
   Developers push code to the **GitHub repository**.

2. **Automated Build**  
   Jenkins automatically detects the changes and triggers a **build pipeline**.

3. **Code Quality Check**  
   SonarQube scans the code for **bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells**.

4. **Security Scanning**  
   - **OWASP ZAP** checks for web application security vulnerabilities.  
   - **Trivy** scans Docker images and project dependencies for vulnerabilities.

5. **Docker Containerization**  
   The application is **containerized** using Docker to ensure consistent environments.

6. **Deployment**  
   Jenkins deploys the containerized application to a **test/staging environment**.

7. **Notifications & Reports**  
   Build status, code quality reports, and security scan results are **automatically sent** to the team.
