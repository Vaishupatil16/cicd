## 🏗 Project Workflow

1. **Code Commit**  
   Developers push code to the GitHub repository.

2. **Automated Build**  
   Jenkins automatically detects the changes and triggers a build pipeline.

3. **Code Quality Check**  
   SonarQube scans the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

4. **Security Scanning**  
   - **OWASP ZAP** checks for web application security vulnerabilities.  
   - **Trivy** scans Docker images and project dependencies for vulnerabilities.  

5. **Docker Containerization**  
   The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent environments.

6. **Deployment**  
   Jenkins deploys the containerized application to a test/staging environment.

7. **Monitoring & Visualization**  
   - **Prometheus** collects metrics from the application and infrastructure.  
   - **Grafana** visualizes these metrics in dashboards for real-time monitoring.  

8. **Notifications & Reports**  
   Build status, code quality reports, security scan results, and monitoring alerts are automatically sent to the team.
